# DL_framework_optic_nerve_stimulation
Built on top of the idea of leveraging Machine Learning frameworks to close the “loop” in the cortex using computational models to elicit more naturalistic visual sensations presented in [Romeni et al. 2021, Patterns] by generalizing to more complex neural networks including CNNs and RNNs.
